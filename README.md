# DAV Project: COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization (Spain Focus)

##  Project Overview
This project provides an interactive and statistical exploration of the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on Spain, comparing it to other countries including Poland and key European nations. It aims to offer multi-dimensional insights using data visualization, time series forecasting, and policy analysis.

##  Datasets Used
（All data were collected from public sources）
Key CSV files:
- `cases_deaths_spain.csv`: Daily cases & deaths in Spain
- `cases_deaths_worldwide.csv`: Global daily stats
- `vaccinations_age_spain.csv`: Age-wise vaccination data
- `hospital_spain.csv`: Hospitalization rates by age group
- `oxcgrt_policy_spain.csv`: Spain's policy stringency data
- `cases_per_province.csv`: Province-level breakdowns

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing & analysis
  - `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Seaborn`
- **HTML/CSS**: For embedding dashboards
- **AR models**: For time series forecasting
