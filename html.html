    <h1>COVID-19 in Spain</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Spain was one of the first European countries to be heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country faced multiple waves of infection, each with different characteristics in terms of transmission, severity, and public health response. This page offers a visual overview of the pandemic's trajectory in Spain, supported by data visualizations that highlight key moments and trends.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>The first major indicator of the pandemic's evolution is the number of new confirmed cases over time. This metric shows the magnitude and timing of the different waves.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/cases.png" alt="Daily COVID-19 Cases in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 1: Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Spain.</div>
        </div>
        <p>The graph shows that after several intense waves, the number of daily cases began to decline steadily in 2022, indicating the beginning of a more controlled phase of the pandemic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>While case numbers reflect the spread of the virus, the number of deaths reveals its human cost, particularly during the early months of the crisis.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/deaths.png" alt="Daily COVID-19 Deaths in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 2: Daily COVID-19 related deaths reported in Spain.</div>
        </div>
        <p>In the early stages, the death toll was extremely high, especially in March and April 2020. This was largely due to limited knowledge of the virus, lack of treatments, and overwhelmed health systems. Later waves showed significantly fewer deaths thanks to better medical care and the impact of vaccination.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>This interactive view allows us to compare the evolution of confirmed cases by year during each year of the pandemic.</p>
        <iframe src="images/cases_per_year_interactive.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 3: Interactive visualization of COVID-19 cases by year.</div>
        <p>The steep rise in 2020 is followed by an even greater surge in 2021, with a marked decline in 2022 thanks to vaccination and acquired immunity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>One of the groups most affected by the pandemic was the elderly. Monitoring how the virus impacted people aged 60 and over helps us understand the vulnerabilities of this population.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/over_60.png" alt="COVID-19 Trends in People Aged 60+">
            <div class="caption">Figure 4: COVID-19 trends in individuals aged 60 and older.</div>
        </div>
        <p>This graph highlights how the elderly were disproportionately affected during the early waves. However, with targeted vaccination and protective measures, the situation improved in later phases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Another important way to understand the pandemic’s evolution is by tracking how quickly cases grew. The chart below shows the weekly percentage growth of COVID-19 cases over time.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/wpg.png" alt="Weekly Percentage Growth in Cases in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 5: Weekly percentage growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases in Spain.</div>
        </div>
        <p>The initial weeks saw explosive growth, with some weeks exceeding 1000% increase. Over time, the weekly growth rate stabilized near zero, indicating control of the outbreak.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <p>Another important metric is the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which indicates how deadly the disease is relative to the number of confirmed infections.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/cfr.png" alt="Case Fatality Rate in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 6: Case Fatality Rate (CFR) per 100 confirmed cases in Spain.</div>
        </div>
        <p>The CFR was extremely high during the first months, but it decreased quickly as testing expanded and milder cases were detected. This also reflects the improvement in medical protocols and patient care.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>The pressure on hospitals was one of the key challenges during the pandemic. Understanding the evolution of hospital and ICU occupancy helps measure the burden on the healthcare system.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/hospital_metrics.png" alt="COVID-19 Hospital Metrics in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 7: Hospital and ICU occupancy, and weekly admissions in Spain.</div>
        </div>
        <p>After the critical waves of 2020 and early 2021, hospital metrics began to stabilize, reflecting the transition from crisis mode to a more manageable phase of healthcare response.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>In addition to national trends, it's useful to compare how each region evolved individually. The following visualization presents cumulative cases per community.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/ccaa.png" alt="Total Cases by Autonomous Community">
            <div class="caption">Figure 8: Cumulative COVID-19 cases per autonomous community.</div>
        </div>
        <p>The differences in total case numbers reflect demographic, geographic, and healthcare capacity factors. Regions with stronger containment strategies also show slightly better outcomes.</p>
    </div>


    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <iframe src="images/cases_per_ccaa_inter.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 9: Interactive chart showing daily cases by autonomous community.</div>
                <div class="chart">

            <div class="caption">Figure 10: Animated bar chart of cumulative COVID-19 cases in each autonomous community (CCAA) in Spain over time.</div>
        </div>
<p>This visualizations clearly shows that Madrid, Catalonia, Valencia and Andalusia were among the most affected regions, with peaks occurring at slightly different times.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Looking at a more granular level, the distribution of cases by province reveals interesting insights about geographic patterns and urban versus rural spread.</p>
        <iframe src="images/int_map.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 11: Interactive map of COVID-19 cases by province in Spain.</div>
        <p>The highest concentration of cases corresponds to densely populated areas, highlighting the role of mobility and population density in transmission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Some provinces consistently reported more cases than others. The following chart presents the top 5 provinces with the most cumulative cases.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/top5provinces.gif" alt="COVID-19 Daily Cases in Top 5 Spanish Provinces">
            <div class="caption">Figure 12: Top 5 provinces with the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia lead in total cases, largely due to their population size and central role in economic and social activities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Vaccination has been a turning point in the pandemic. Monitoring vaccine uptake provides context for the reduction in severe outcomes.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/vaccinations.png" alt="Vaccination Progress in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 13: COVID-19 vaccination progress in Spain over time.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Vaccination campaigns began slowly but accelerated significantly in 2021, with high coverage achieved by the end of the year. This helped reduce hospitalizations and deaths in later waves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Vaccination coverage varied by age group. Older populations were prioritized, which had a visible effect on mortality reduction.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/spain_vacc_age.png" alt="Vaccination by Age Group in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 14: Latest vaccination coverage per 100 people, by age group.</div>
<iframe src="images/interactive_spain_vacc_age.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 15: Interactive plot of vaccination coverage in Spain by age group over time.</div>
        
        </div>

        <p>Vaccination rates reached nearly 100% in the 80+ age group, while coverage among younger children remained significantly lower, reflecting policy and risk-based prioritization.</p>
    </div>




    <div class="section">
        <p>Understanding how different COVID-19 indicators are related helps identify patterns and anticipate healthcare demands. The following correlation matrix quantifies the strength of these relationships.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/spain_correlation_matrix.png" alt="Correlation Matrix of COVID Metrics">
            <div class="caption">Figure 16: Correlation matrix between cases, deaths, and hospital metrics in Spain.</div>
        </div>
        <p>The chart shows a strong correlation between ICU and hospital occupancy, and a moderate correlation between new cases and deaths. These insights are useful for resource planning.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <p>Public policy responses played a major role in managing the pandemic. The Stringency Index summarizes the severity of government-imposed restrictions such as lockdowns, school closures, and travel bans.</p>
        <iframe src="images/interactive_policy_stringency.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 17: Interactive plot of Spain's COVID-19 policy stringency index over time.</div>
        <p>The data shows sharp increases in restrictions during major waves, followed by gradual relaxation. The most stringent period occurred during the initial 2020 lockdown, with subsequent fluctuations based on case surges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Finally, we take a closer look at the specific public health measures adopted in Spain over time, broken down by type of restriction (schools, workplaces, gatherings, etc.).</p>
        <div class="chart">

            <div class="caption">Figure 18: Timeline of major policy interventions in Spain.</div>
        </div>
        <p>This visualization helps explain the effects of policy decisions on infection dynamics. Stringent restrictions—especially during the first wave—were gradually relaxed, with targeted reintroductions during critical moments in 2021 and early 2022.</p>

        <h2>Forecasting COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Spain</h2>
        <p>In this section, we present a forecast of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Spain using monthly aggregated data. This approach was chosen because aggregating by months we can significantly improve the performance of forecasting models. It also helps avoid the common issue of models predicting zero values when trained on recent flat data.</p>
        <p>By using data from 2020 to 2022 and applying an AR(10) model, the goal is to capture medium-term trends during the core period of the pandemic, rather than focusing only on the decline seen in 2023–2024. This gives more realistic and informative projections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>The following chart shows the forecast of monthly COVID-19 cases in Spain.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/prediction_cases.png" alt="Forecast of COVID-19 Cases in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 19: Forecast of COVID-19 monthly cases using AR(10) model (2020–2022 data).</div>
        </div>
        <p>Aggregating the data monthly helped smooth out noise and allowed the model to capture general trends and seasonality more effectively.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>We also generated a similar forecast for monthly COVID-19 deaths in Spain, using the same method and time window.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/prediction_deaths.png" alt="Forecast of COVID-19 Deaths in Spain">
            <div class="caption">Figure 20: Forecast of COVID-19 monthly deaths using AR(10) model (2020–2022 data).</div>
        </div>
        <p>This prediction provides a realistic view of expected mortality trends, again supported by the stability gained from monthly data aggregation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Spain and Poland: A Comparative Perspective</h2>
        <p>To better understand the COVID-19 situation in Spain, it is helpful to compare it with another European country. Poland serves as an interesting counterpart due to differences in demographics, healthcare infrastructure, and public policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>We start by situating both countries in the global context of COVID-19. The following interactive chart shows the top 10 countries by number of confirmed cases.</p>
        <iframe src="images/interactive_top10_world_cases.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 21: Interactive chart of countries with the most reported COVID-19 cases globally.</div>
        <p>Spain appears consistently among the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases, while Poland, though smaller, also experienced multiple strong waves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>To place Spain and Poland in the broader European context, the following chart compares total COVID-19 cases across some of the most affected countries in Europe.</p>
        <div class="chart">
            <img src="images/europe.png" alt="Total COVID-19 Cases in Top European Countries">
            <div class="caption">Figure 22: Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in selected European countries.</div>
        </div>
        <p>Spain had a consistently high total case count, though still below countries like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Poland, while having a smaller population, remained in the lower range of total cases throughout the pandemic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>When comparing daily new cases between Spain and Poland (7-day moving average), we observe differences in timing and magnitude of the waves.</p>
        <div class="chart">

        </div>
        <p>Spain had more intense early waves, while Poland experienced stronger peaks in the later phase of the pandemic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>The next chart compares the number of deaths over time in both countries, again using a 7-day average to smooth out fluctuations.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Despite Spain's higher total number of cases, Poland suffered very severe mortality spikes during certain periods, likely reflecting differences in healthcare strain and vaccine uptake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Vaccination played a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of the pandemic. The following interactive plot compares the overall vaccination rates in both countries.</p>
        <iframe src="images/overall_vaccination_rate_poland_vs_spain.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 25: Interactive comparison of overall vaccination rates between Spain and Poland.</div>
        <p>Spain achieved consistently higher coverage, which may explain the lower relative mortality in later waves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Looking specifically at booster coverage reveals further differences in public health uptake.</p>
        <iframe src="images/booster_coverage_poland_vs_spain.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <div class="caption">Figure 26: Booster dose coverage in Poland and Spain over time.</div>
        <p>While both countries launched booster campaigns, Spain reached more widespread coverage across age groups.</p>
